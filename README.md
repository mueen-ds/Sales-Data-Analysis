## 🔑 Key Insight – Total Sales by Product
Monitor stands out as the top-selling product, with total sales reaching close to 380 units, indicating it’s in high demand and likely a primary revenue driver.

USB-C Cable and Webcam follow, showing moderate sales between 75–80 and 40–45 units respectively, suggesting consistent consumer need.

Products like Keyboard, Mouse, and Laptop Stand had relatively lower sales, with totals ranging from 25 to 35 units, possibly due to lower demand or niche use cases.

This breakdown can help prioritize inventory restocking, promotions, or bundling strategies around high-performing products like Monitors and Cables.
